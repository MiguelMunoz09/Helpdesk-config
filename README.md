# Helpdesk-config

This is a console application, designed for the automation of the work environment in an organization.
It was designed primarily for Linux and Mac OS operating systems.

allows automatic download of applications such as: slack, clickup, clockify, google chrome, firefox, Github, visual studio code, docker, postman, adobe and figma.

This application allows you to configure your work environment, as the case may be.

Since its design, it implements both the development sector and the design sector and other employees of the organization.

Within the console, you will be able to see a form that gives you the possibility to choose the application package that best suits you.
